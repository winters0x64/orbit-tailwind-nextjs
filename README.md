This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It features a minimal installation of [Orbit components]("https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit"), with both Tailwind and `styled-components` correctly set up and with minimal customization.

(`styled-components` is still in use because the migration to Tailwind is not fully complete).

The idea with this repository is to make it easier to share bug reports.

You can for example open the repository on Codesandbox or Stackblitz, make your modifications and then share the link as a reproduction.
